I developed a SMS email classifier using machine learning techniques. The system employs a supervised learning approach, with a dataset of labeled SMS and email messages used to train a classifier model. The model uses natural language processing techniques, such as tokenization and stemming, to preprocess the text data and extract features. These features are then used to train a classifier, such as a Naive Bayes or Support Vector Machine model, to distinguish between SMS and email messages.

The performance of the classifier was evaluated using standard metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score, and achieved an accuracy of X% on a held-out test set. To further improve the model, I employed techniques such as feature selection and hyperparameter tuning, which helped to optimize the model's performance.

Overall, the SMS email classifier provides a valuable tool for automatically categorizing incoming messages, improving communication efficiency and reducing manual sorting efforts.
